# SemanticVersioning

## Introduction
This task is intended for prospective .NET developers to demonstrate competency in the following areas:

Creating applications using well-written C# code
- JSON and file manipulation
- Writing tests
- Writing supporting documentation
## Exercise
The enclosed JSON file contains a version number in a semantic format (Major.Minor.Patch) where each part should be numeric.

The minor or patch number needs to be incremented depending on the type of release of the application:

- For a minor release, the minor number is incremented and the patch number is reset to zero.
- For a patch release, the patch number is incremented.
Please write:

A console application which takes as its argument the type of release of the application. It should read the version object from the file, increment the applicationâ€™s version number according to the rules above, and save it back to the file, leaving any other contents unaltered.

Output
Your output should include:

- C# code to provide the solution
- Unit tests
- Appropriate documentation
- An accessible online code repository
